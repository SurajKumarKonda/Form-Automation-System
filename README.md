# Form Automation System

This project automates the bulk submission of responses to a Zoho Form using Selenium and data from an Excel spreadsheet. It reads each row of user data, fills out the corresponding fields in the form (such as name, email, date of birth, city, state, phone, and Instagram handle), and submits the form automatically.

The script handles dropdowns, text inputs, and logs the status of each submission (success or error) in a log file for easy tracking. This tool is useful for efficiently managing large-scale form submissions without manual entry.
